# Universal-Bluecheck
Universal Bluecheck aims to combat AI-generated impersonation and verify media authenticity before sharing content on web 2 apps like Instagram, Spotify, and Facebook.

## PROBLEM
Ever since the rise of artificial intelligence in the past years, some major problems have arisen, one notable one being a compromised authenticity for published media. AI is time and again being used to make people let notable figures say things that they did not say by mimicking their voice and likeness. This can lead to several significant problems including: 
•	Spread of false information, creating confusion and misleading the public leading to damaging of the reputation of notable figures, public figures, or even ordinary individuals by attributing false statements or actions to them.
•	Political manipulation, causing public distrust in genuine political figures and institutions.
•	Creation fake incidents or speeches that promote hate speech, discrimination, or violence, leading to social unrest.
•	Promotion of identity theft and fraud, making it difficult to verify the authenticity of individuals in various contexts.

## SOLUTION
Universal bluecheck dapp can be used to prove authenticity of media. The application can give you a certification that the user actually published media on whatever platform it’s on. This acts kind of like the Instagram or twitter blue check except for multiple social media platforms.
